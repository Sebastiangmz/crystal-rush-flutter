# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Crystal Rush** - A 2D Flutter mobile game featuring an endless runner/collector gameplay where players jump between platforms, collect crystals, and avoid obstacles. Built using the Flame game engine for optimal 2D performance.

### Current Implementation Status
- âœ… **Core Game Engine**: Flame-based game loop with collision detection
- âœ… **Player Character**: Physics-based movement with jump mechanics
- âœ… **Platform System**: Procedural generation and collision handling
- âœ… **Crystal Collection**: Scoring system with visual feedback
- âœ… **UI System**: Menu, game overlay, pause, and game over screens
- âœ… **Game States**: Complete state management (menu/playing/paused/game over)
- âœ… **Progressive Difficulty**: Speed increases over time
- âœ… **Mobile Controls**: Touch-optimized tap-to-jump controls

### Repository Information
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Sebastiangmz/crystal-rush-flutter
- **Main Branch**: master
- **Last Updated**: Initial implementation with full playable game

## Development Commands

```bash
# Project setup
flutter create crystal_rush .
flutter pub get

# Development
flutter run                    # Run on connected device/emulator
flutter run -d chrome          # Run in web browser for testing
flutter run --hot               # Enable hot reload

# Building
flutter build apk              # Android APK
flutter build appbundle        # Android App Bundle (for Play Store)
flutter build ios             # iOS build (requires macOS)

# Testing
flutter test                   # Run all tests
flutter test test/game/        # Run game-specific tests
flutter test --coverage       # Generate coverage report

# Code quality
flutter analyze               # Static analysis
dart format lib/ test/        # Format code
```

## Architecture Overview

### Game Engine Structure
- **Flame Framework**: Primary 2D game engine handling sprites, animations, and game loops
- **Component-Entity Pattern**: Game objects (player, platforms, enemies) as separate components
- **Game State Management**: Centralized state handling for menus, gameplay, and settings

### Core Game Systems
- **Spawning System**: âœ… Procedural generation of platforms and crystals
- **Physics System**: âœ… Collision detection, gravity, and movement mechanics
- **Game State System**: âœ… Menu, playing, paused, and game over states
- **Scoring System**: âœ… Crystal collection and score tracking
- **Camera System**: âœ… Smooth player following and viewport management
- **Progression System**: ðŸ”„ XP, leveling, currency (future implementation)
- **Audio System**: ðŸ”„ Background music, sound effects (future implementation)

### Key Dependencies (Currently Implemented)
```yaml
flame: ^1.10.0                  # âœ… 2D game engine (core functionality)
flame_audio: ^2.0.0            # ðŸ”„ Audio management (added but not used yet)
shared_preferences: ^2.2.0     # ðŸ”„ Local storage (added but not used yet)
google_mobile_ads: ^3.0.0      # ðŸ”„ Monetization (future implementation)
firebase_core: ^2.24.0         # ðŸ”„ Analytics/Crashlytics (future implementation)
```

```

### Game Mechanics Implementation
- **Progressive Difficulty**: âœ… Speed increases based on time survived
- **Collection Mechanics**: âœ… Crystal gathering with score feedback
- **Collision System**: âœ… Platform landing and crystal collection detection
- **Camera System**: âœ… Smooth following player movement
- **Game Over Conditions**: âœ… Falling off screen or getting left behind

### Future Features (Not Yet Implemented)
- **Power-up System**: Temporary abilities with visual indicators and timers
- **Particle Effects**: Visual feedback for collections and explosions
- **Audio System**: Background music and sound effects
- **Daily Challenges**: Time-based objectives stored locally with reset logic
- **Enemy System**: Obstacles and moving hazards

### Monetization Strategy (Future Implementation)
- **Rewarded Video Ads**: Optional ads for power-ups, extra lives, and currency
- **Cosmetic IAPs**: Character skins, particle trails, and visual customizations
- **Battle Pass**: Seasonal progression system with free and premium tiers

### Performance Considerations
- **Sprite Batching**: Efficient rendering of multiple similar objects
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse game objects to minimize garbage collection
- **Audio Preloading**: Cache frequently used sound effects
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Game logic, scoring system, and progression mechanics
- **Widget Tests**: UI screens and game overlays
- **Integration Tests**: Full gameplay sessions and state transitions
- **Performance Tests**: Frame rate stability and memory usage monitoring
